# Superstore Sales Dashboard (Excel)

ðŸ“Š **My First Excel Dashboard Project**  

Previously, I mainly used Power BI for data visualization and reporting.  
I had never tried building dashboards in Excel, so I decided to explore Excelâ€™s capabilities for analysis and reporting.  
This project is my starting point â€” I focused on basic features like PivotTables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers, without going into advanced Excel functions.

## Project Steps
1. **Dataset Download** â€“ Downloaded the Superstore dataset from Kaggle in CSV format.  
2. **Data Import** â€“ Used Excel's *Get Data â†’ From Text/CSV* to import the dataset.  
3. **Data Cleaning (Power Query)** â€“  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Checked for missing values  
   - Formatted date columns
   - Removed unnecessary spaces in text columns  
   - Added calculated columns like Month Name, Delivery Days, Profit Margin %, etc  
4. **KPI Creation** â€“ Built separate PivotTables to calculate key metrics.  
5. **Charts & Visualizations** â€“ Created bar, column, and line charts to show trends and comparisons.  
6. **Slicers for Interactivity** â€“ Added Year, Category, and Region slicers linked to all PivotTables.  
7. **Dashboard Design** â€“  
   - Merged cells for title and added icon ðŸ“Š  
   - Used consistent color theme  
   - Arranged KPIs at top, charts below, slicers on right  
8. **Finalization** â€“ Saved the dashboard as `.xlsx` and exported screenshot for preview.
